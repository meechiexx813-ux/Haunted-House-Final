# Haunted House – Modified Stealth Game  
## Final Project – Jan Di Sapone & Demetrius Dorsey

## Project Overview
This project is a modified version of the Haunted House stealth game. It includes one major gameplay modification and one minor visual modification. These additions were designed to expand player strategy, interaction, and atmosphere while maintaining the core mechanics of the original assignment.

## Major Modification: Charged Dash with Cooldown and UI Bar
We replaced the original dash mechanic with a fully custom charged dash system that allows the player to build power and travel farther based on charge duration.

### Features
- Holding the dash key charges dash power.
- Releasing the key triggers a dash whose distance depends on how long the key was held.
- A fully charged dash allows the player to teleport a short distance.
- A UI slider bar displays cooldown progress before the dash can be used again.

### Task Notes
- Added a new Input Action specifically for the charged dash.
- Modified the original movement script to include charging logic.
- Implemented values for charge time, dash distance, cooldown mechanics, and teleportation behavior.
- Integrated a UI Slider to visually represent dash cooldown.
  
This modification significantly changes how players navigate the environment and escape enemies.

## Minor Modification: Ghost Flicker Visibility Effect
For the minor modification, we created a subtle visual effect where ghosts fade in and out of visibility.

### Notes
- This change is purely visual/aesthetic.
- It does not affect ghost behavior, detection, or gameplay mechanics.
- Implemented by adjusting material alpha values over time.

This adds atmosphere without changing the core gameplay loop.
