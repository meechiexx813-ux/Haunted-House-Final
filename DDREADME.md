DEMETRIUS (MEECH) DORSEY README

Who are your team members?: Jan Di Sapone and Demetrius Dorsey

What are the modifications you made to the game?: We added speed to Ivan and also gave him a cutting edge flash step where he can go through walls. The ghost do a phase in and phase out affect on their meshes to make them more ghastly. 

What’s the biggest challenge you’ve had so far?: We had issues with the coding since the game was built on an old unity version. The player controls did not want to operate. The obserrver and the Game Ending took some time to air out as well. 

Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?: I don't think I'd pick up this specific project again but it was fun getting to learn some core game mechcanics!
